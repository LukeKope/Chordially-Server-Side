1. Have data coming through from firebase locally, having issues with Heroku. Look into this.
2. Get ability to write data up and running
3. Connect this functionality with the NPM creact-react-app so I can make API calls from the react app!


when you're creating a user in firebase, that's one thing. There's only a couple things you can have (username, email, etc.)

the actual data you're attributing to the user, data apart from the authentication.

Authentication in the final project will be exactly like exercise 5

The rest of the data should look like exercise 4, an API that has uniform data to send to firebase and get data from firebase. So the only thing
you need to get the data from exercise 4 is the user ID.

Data part is exercise 4, authentication part is exercise 5


NEED THE UID TO GET REFERENCE TO THE USER
